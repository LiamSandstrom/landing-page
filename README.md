# landing-page
Created: 24/03/2025

After:
I'm happy with how it went. It was overwhelming at first to have a blank page but i took 1 section at a time, broke it down and started from there. I feel like i got an basic grasp of how flexbox works now as i had to do some flexbox nesting etc. I'm happy that i did not spend time on stuff outside the assignment like adding mobile support etc and was happy with good enough. Added some basic hover and clicked effects as it make the project more enjoyable :))

Before:
I will have to make a website layout using Flexbox.
I will try to practice commit more often during this project.
